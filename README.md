### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# About-Me

I'm an accountant specialized in finance and tax but very interested in solving problems through data, programming, automation and AI.  My academic background, with a Bachelor of Commerce (Accounting and Finance) from Buenos Aires University and a Masterâ€™s in Finance from UCEMA, has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of the economic variables within the business world. This education enables me to work effectively with data to extract valuable insights or develop solutions to specific problems. My expertise in accounting and finance positions me to navigate and analyze the complex financial landscapes, turning data into actionable intelligence for strategic decision-making.

I am a self-learner, which has enabled me to develop various tools using Python programming and conduct basic queries with SQL. From this point, having taken courses in data analytics and data science, I aim to continue my learning journey to enhance my data manipulation skills further. This ongoing education will improve my understanding of data and my ability to solve complex problems effectively. My goal is to leverage these capabilities to uncover insights that drive informed business decisions and strategic initiatives.

I'm always open to collaborating on projects that leverage my skills in finance, data analysis, and programming to solve real-world problems. Feel free to reach out if you think we can create something amazing together.

Skills: Python, PowerQUERY, PowerBI, SQL, Excel, fianance and economics.
